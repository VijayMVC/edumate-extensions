-- Student Attendance Summary

-- A summative report that lists student attendance statistics over a fortnight, as well as year to date.
-- This report calculates explained/unexplained absences/lates, as well as cumulative absences/lates as an average per fortnight.

-- Results are grouped by home room, and then sorted by *'Absences YTD'*

-- This report pipes it's results to a SXW template (attendance/student-attendance-summary.sxw) which is emailed to
-- Year Coordinators as well as Pastoral Assistants every fortnight on Friday night.
